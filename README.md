## Introduction

In an era where trust is paramount, the lack of transparency and efficiency in the charity sector has left donors questioning where their money truly goes. With 97% of Malaysian non-profit foundations failing to publish financial reports and a significant number receiving poor ratings due to inadequate information, the traditional charity model is ripe for disruption. 

VeriFund leverages blockchain to provide a trustworthy and interactive platform for both donors and charity organizations. Our solution not only verifies and tracks the flow of funds but also encourages active donor engagement—allowing the public to score the impact of the projects they support.

---

## The Problem

- **Transparency:**  
  Nearly all non-profit foundations fail to publicly share financial reports, making it hard for donors to trace the allocation of funds.
- **Efficiency:**  
  A staggering 65% of foundations are rated 0 due to incomplete or inadequate disclosure, resulting in delayed or mismanaged fund distribution.
- **Limited Donor Engagement:**  
  With only 3.27% of foundations releasing impact reports, donors lack direct insights into the outcomes of their contributions.

---

## Our Solution

VeriFund is designed to tackle these challenges head-on:
- **Transparent Transactions:** Every donor transaction and project update is recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger.
- **Oracle-Driven Verification:** Blockchain oracles validate off-chain evidence such as official documents and images, stamping the verification back on-chain.
- **Automated Fund Release:** Smart contracts automatically release raised funds once a charity project is verified, ensuring rapid and error-free disbursement.
- **Interactive Donor Feedback:** Donors can track project progress in real time and provide feedback through an impact scoring system, enhancing trust and accountability.

---

## Key Features

- **Immutable Ledger:**  
  All transactions are recorded on a tamper-proof blockchain, providing a transparent audit trail.

- **Blockchain Oracle Integration:**  
  Real-world evidence is seamlessly verified using blockchain oracles to authenticate documents, images, and other media before being recorded.

- **Smart Contracts:**  
  Automated processes ensure that funds are disbursed only when predefined verification criteria are met.

- **Interactive Donor Engagement:**  
  Donors can review project updates, track funding allocation, and submit impact scores, fostering continuous improvement and trust.

- **Shariah Compliance:**  
  Designed with ethical fundraising in mind, our business model supports Shariah-compliant practices with revenue generated from platform fees, promotional tools, and mudarabah partnerships with NGOs.

  Provides an immutable record of all transactions and project updates.

  Bridge the gap between off-chain evidence and the blockchain for reliable, verifiable data input.
